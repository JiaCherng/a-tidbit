Spiderman: No Way Home swept the world of movie watchers, with many of my friends even going so far as to acclaim it as the best Marvel movie ever, even ahead of that of Endgame. Let's be honest, Endgame was a cliche superhero movies, just with more superheroes and an extra poignant factor since a good number of the OGs will be bowing out. To be clear, it's far from bad, it is special in its own way, but if you were to summarise the plot, it would really just be another 'superhero movie'. <br><br>

Spiderman: No Way Home is really more of the same. Old Villains, old heroes, an extra heavy dose of nostalgia and in essence, another 'superhero movie' Good guy wants to save someone, good guy meets someone strong and rational that tries to convince him to do the rational thing, good guy thinks he can save everyone, good guy gets a lot of help along the way, but in the end good guy loses more than what he saved. Familiar?<br><br>

Encanto is the same, but it doesn't have to rely on the one-hit wonder of nostalgia, and the desire of cinema goers to see the old cast again to pull you in. This time it is good girl dejected, good girl helps others, good girl misunderstood, good girl saves the world with her own compassion/love/kindness and infects others with it as well. Familiar? <br><br>

I know, I know, I've been ranting for some time now, time to get to the heart of the matter. Watching encanto was a much more enjoyable experience for me than the other. It's not because of the plot, in most animated movie or superhero/supervillain movie, you'll know the flow of the story before the first scene starts playing. As long as it's not obvious enough that you can anticipate the next scene, it's good enough. However, the the music and the setting was so immersive and intriguing. I want to catch every word of the lyrics, while trying to sit back and enjoy the song. The magic of Lin-Manuel Miranda strikes here. <br><br>

All in all, Encanto was a much more pleasant and immersing experience than Spiderman: No Way Home, it left me feeling all warm inside, which is more than what could be say of Spiderman. Oh, maybe I should just state here that I am bias and all the above represents my personal views.
